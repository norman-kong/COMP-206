This repository contains my assignments and labs for the course COMP 206 (Introduction to Software Systems) at McGill University (F2020). PDFs for the assignments, my final exam submission and the labs are not posted as requested by the professor. 

Notes for myself: 
- A4: almost done
- labF: almost done, small thing at end doesnâ€™t work
- labG: mostly done, but why are str and str2 combined? 
- labJ: not done
- lab K: incomplete because I don't know what source file they are talking about
