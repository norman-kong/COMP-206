# COMP 206

This repository contains my assignments and labs for the course COMP 206 (Introduction to Software Systems) at McGill University (F2020). PDFs for the assignments, my final exam submission and the labs are not posted as requested by the professor. 

### A1: Familiarization of Linux. 
- 1. Recreate a given folder structure and demonstrate bash commands.
- 2. Editing files with vi.
- 3. Demonstrating `grep`.
- 4. Transferring files using the FTP (File Transfer Protocol).  

### A2: Bash Scripting 
- 1. A bash script (`backup.sh`) that takes an individual file/directory and backs it up into a tar file. Example: `./backup.sh [location to save to] [data to save]`.
- 2. A bash script that compares the text files between two directories.
 
### A3: Unix Scripting 
- 1. A bash script ('webmetrics.sh`) to parse webserver logs and produce metrics (num. of requests coming from the browsers Safari, Firefox and Chrome, num. of distinct users (IP addresses) per day, top 20 popular requests by product ID).
- 2. A bash script (`runlogs.sh`) to run `webmetrics.sh` on some log files.
 
### A4: C Programming & Character Arrays + Control Structures 
- 1. A C program (`scal.c`) that has the same functionality as a scientific calculator. It can perform calculations over arbitrarily large numbers. It accepts `x`, `op`, `y`, where `x` and `y` are integers and `op` is an arithmetic operator.

### A5: C Programming & File IO 
- 1. A C program (`report.c`) that analyzes user event data (`data.csv`, containing `User, Attempt, Date, Time, Event, IP Address`) that searches student exam data to detect possible collaboration. This is done by we analyzing the IP address of the events, as IP addresses are good indicators of proximity.
- 2. A tester script (`mini5tester.sh`).
 
### A6: C Programming & Dynamic Memory
- 1. A C program (`wcloud`) that reads through all text files passed in as its argument and generates a counter of all words in all files, in alphabetical order. 

Notes for myself: 
- labF: almost done, small thing at end doesnâ€™t work
- labG: mostly done, but why are str and str2 combined? 
- labJ: not done
- lab K: incomplete because I don't know what source file they are talking about
